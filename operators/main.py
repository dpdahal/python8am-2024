# what is operators?
# Operators are special symbols in Python that carry out arithmetic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called the operand.

# list of operators
# Arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, //
# print(10%3)
# print(2**4)
# print(19//5)
# Comparison operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# print(4==5)
# print(4!=5)
# Logical operators: and, or, not
# print(4==4 and 4!=5)
# print(4==5 or 4!=5)
# print(not 4==5)
# Bitwise operators: &, |, ~, ^, >>, <<
# print(5&6)
# print(bin(5))
# print(bin(6))
# # 101
# # 110
# # 100
# print(bin(4))
# Assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=
# a=5
# a+=60
# print(a)
# Identity operators: is, is not
# Membership operators: in, not in

# a=5
# b=6
# c=a
# print(a is b)
# print(a is c)
# print(a is not b)
# print(a is not c)

# name ='hari'
# print('h' in name)
# print('h' not in name)
# print('s' in name)
